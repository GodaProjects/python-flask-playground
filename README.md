# python-flask-playground
A playground project for flask framework


##### Run the command for creating a virtual env (silimar for npm init)
Please note that this is generally python and has nothing to do with Flask. This is basically to make sure that the dependencies are within the project and not installed for the whole environment.
1. First install the virtualenv clt
```
https://github.com/GodaProjects/python-flask-playground.git

```
virtualenv goda-flask
```
3. Install flask and flash sql
```
pip3 install flask flask-sqlalchemy
```

4. Create a home app file like app.js in express
